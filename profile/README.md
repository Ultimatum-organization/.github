  <h2> Welcome to Ultimatum, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization dedicated to pushing the limits of DAOs and big tech.</h2>

  <br/>
  Everything made by Ultimatum can, and most likely will, change over time as more contributions are made by the community.<br>
  <br/>
  The current ideal functionality for the Ultimatum project:<br>
  <ul>
    <i>Fully functional blockchain</i><br>
    <i>Voting system made and used by the community</i><br>
    <i>Reputation verification system</i><br>
    <i>Github integration which allows: pull requests to be voted on, issues to be voted on etc.</i><br><br>
  </ul>

  <h2>But what actually is Ultimatum?</h2>
  basically theres this awesome thing called a DAO or Decentralized Autonomous Organization. People can join the organization and do work for it as they please. The organization is special because the community votes on what they want to implement and implement it themselves rather than one top person or group making decisions and writing code.<br><br>
 
The idea behind mine is that im going to integrate with github so that when someone wants a feature, they can start a poll for it. If that poll goes their way, people can code it and the community decides whether or not it is implemented into the main project (this prevents any rogue code making its way in). essentially everything about it is run by the community.<br><br>
 
To prevent attacks, there will be a reputation system where you must either contribute to small votes to make your way up or invest in the project by purchasing or mining a certain amount of the token associated with the organization. This coin or token will also be given to people who contribute by writing code and doing influential things in the community.<br><br>
 
People can then sell that token to other people who want it so they can contribute and the cycle goes on.<br><br>
