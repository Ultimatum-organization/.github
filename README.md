    <i>Fully functional blockchain</i><br>
    <i>Voting system made and used by the community</i><br>
    <i>Reputation verification system</i><br>
    <i>Github integration which allows:</i><br>
    <ul>
      <i>pull requests to be voted on<br>
      <i>issues to be voted on etc.</i><br><br>
    </ul>
